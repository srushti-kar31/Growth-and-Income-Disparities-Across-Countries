# 📊 Economic Growth and Income Disparities Across Countries






## 1.📌 Overview

This project analyzes economic growth patterns and income disparities across countries by comparing developed economies, developing economies, and India over the period 1980–2030.

The study focuses on:

  * GDP Growth Rate (%)
  * Real GDP Growth
  * GDP per Capita (Current Prices, USD)

India’s performance is evaluated both at the regional level and through country-level comparisons with the United States and China.

## 2.🎯 Objectives

  * Compare long-term GDP growth across developed and developing economies
  * Evaluate India’s growth performance relative to global peers
  * Analyze income disparities using GDP per capita
  * Measure economic stability using volatility indicators

**📈 Key Visual Analyses**

  * GDP Growth Comparison: Developed vs Developing vs India
  * Country-Level Comparison: USA vs China
  * Regional Comparison: India vs China
  * Per Capita GDP Trends across economies

## 🔍 Key Findings

**📊 Growth Performance**

India shows strong real GDP growth, outperforming developed economies and the developing economy average.

However, at the country level, China clearly outperforms India in sustained long-term growth.

Median Annual GDP Growth Rate (%)
| Category          | Median Growth |
| ----------------- | ------------: |
| Global Developed  |          2.38 |
| Global Developing |          3.69 |
| **India**         |      **6.48** |


**📉 Economic Stability**

Despite being a developing economy, India exhibits relatively low growth volatility, indicating a comparatively stable growth pattern.

**Economic Instability Metric (Standard Deviation, 1980–2030)**

| Region/Country    | Volatility |
| ----------------- | ---------: |
| Global Developed  |       2.95 |
| Global Developing |       6.26 |
| **India**         |   **2.48** |

**💰 Income Disparities (Per Capita GDP)**

  * High GDP growth does not translate into high per capita income for India.
  * India remains behind both developed economies and China in GDP per capita due to population scale and structural factors.
  * This highlights the persistent gap between aggregate economic growth and individual income outcomes.

**🌍 Country-Level Comparisons**

USA vs China (1980–2024)

  * China experienced rapid income growth (CAGR: 8.94%), significantly narrowing the gap with the USA.
  * Despite this, the USA continues to maintain a much higher per capita income level.

India vs China (1980–2024)

  * China overtook India in per capita GDP as early as 1980 and expanded the gap over time.

**GDP Per Capita (USD, Selected Years)**
| Year |    USA |  China | India |
| ---: | -----: | -----: | ----: |
| 1980 | 12,553 |    308 |   271 |
| 2000 | 36,313 |    963 |   443 |
| 2020 | 64,518 | 10,696 | 1,907 |
| 2024 | 86,145 | 13,314 | 2,695 |

## 🧠 Key Insights

  * Strong economic growth does not automatically imply higher income levels
  * India demonstrates a high-growth yet relatively stable economic pattern
  * Persistent income disparities remain a key challenge
  * Country-specific structural and policy factors play a critical role in long-term outcomes
